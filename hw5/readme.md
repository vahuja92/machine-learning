To run the model, open the ml_pipeline_script.ipynb notebook and run the notebook.

The output "test_run.csv" was produced by running this notebook. 

The notebook allows a user to change the parameters and inputs of the models. 

The notebook imports functions from three python programs:
  - preprocess_helper: Helper functions used to clean the dataset. Imported and used by the preprocess.py script
  - preprocess: The script to clean the datasets (used on the cleaning and test sets separately)
  - ml_pipeline.py: Functions used to build the and evaluate the machine learning models.
